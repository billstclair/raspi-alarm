This directory is intended to be the image of a USB key to plug in to
a Raspberry Pi. If you configure that Raspberry Pi according to the
instructions in "scripts/files/README", it will run
"~pi/bin/startup.sh" at boot time, and play one or more files from
this directory.

"scripts-files/home/pi/bin/startup.sh" works as follows:

It will play the single file "playone.mp3" in this directory, if it
exists.

Otherwise, if the "playall" directory exists, it will play all the
.mp3 files in that directory, in alphabetical order.

Otherwise, if the "playrandom" directory exists, it will play a random
.mp3 file from that directory.

This USB key should be plugged in to the lower-right-hand USB port on
a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, so that the startup code in "/etc/fstab" will
mount it on "/mnt/usbstorage".

This directory is configured with a single MP3 file, "playone.mp3",
which is a ring-tone I've been using for years of the bells from Pink
Floyd's "Time" on "Dark Side of the Moon".

That file is linked three times from each of the "playall.not" and
"playrandom.not" directories. You'll want to replace those files with
the ones you want to play, and rename "playone.mp3" to something else to
use one of the two directories, renaming "playall.not" to "playall" or
"playrandom.not" to "playrandom".

You'll need the "omxplayer" executable, and some fonts to prevent it
from printing a warning about a missing font.

  sudo apt-get install omxplayer
  sudo apt-get install ttf-freefont

I also found useful this guide to headless setup of a Raspberry Pi,
since I didn't have a corded USB mouse or keyboard around, and many
people don't have an HDMI monitor.
