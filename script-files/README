This directory contains the scripts that are necessary to make the
Raspberry Pi run ~pi/bin/startup.sh on startup. The directory
structure below this directory mirrors "/" on the Raspberry Pi.

/etc/fstab                # The /dev/sda1 line is added. The others will differ
/etc/rc.local             # the line running ~/pi/bin/startup.sh is added.
/home/pi/bin/startup.sh   # This is the startup script

You need to setup the /mnt/usbstorage directory as directed at
https://www.htpcguides.com/properly-mount-usb-storage-raspberry-pi

At the very least, this means:

  sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usbstorage
